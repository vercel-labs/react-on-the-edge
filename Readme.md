# React on the Edge

> [!WARNING]  
> Edge Functions have been deprecated. We recommend using the full Node.js runtime with Fluid compute instead. [Learn more here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ngjNfMnvE) or [read the docs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/fluid-compute). Functions using Fluid retain the benefits of Edge Functions, without the downsides of the limited Edge runtime. Further, most workloads have 1-3 regions for their data storage, where you should co-locate your compute. Ensure your Vercel Function region is the same as your database.
